    <strong>1. Retreat</strong>

    <p>
        The easiest way to get out of trouble is to retreat.
        This allows you to move backwards to a place you might be able to defend better
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="center">
    <strong>2. Kamikaze</strong>
    <br>
    <img src="Images/download.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        If retreating does not work and you have nowhere else to go, 
        you should let your soldiers begin to kamikaze to sacrifice themselves
        so you can try to win the battle.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="center">
    <strong>3. Nuclear Weapons</strong>
    <br>

    <p>
        If your soldiers do not want to kamikaze or you are down to your last few
        remaining soldiers, then you should resort to nuclear options.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="center">
    <strong>4. Surrender</strong>
    <br>
    <img src="Images/images.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    <p>
        If somehow did not win the battle after using nuclear weapons,
        you should probably surrender, but remeber you just violated many
        international laws by using nuclear weapons, so run and hide and do
        not let them catch you
